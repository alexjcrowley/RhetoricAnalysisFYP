<h1 id="cornell-conversational-analysis-toolkit">Cornell Conversational Analysis Toolkit</h1>
<p>This toolkit contains tools to extract conversational features and analyze social phenomena in conversations.  Several large <a href="http://zissou.infosci.cornell.edu/socialkit/datasets/">conversational datasets</a> are included together with scripts exemplifying the use of the toolkit on these datasets.</p>
<p>The toolkit currently implements features for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://localhost:8000/Coordination_README.html">Linguistic coordination</a>, a measure of relative power between individuals or groups based on their use of function words (see the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html">Echoes of Power</a> paper)</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://localhost:8000/QuestionTypology_README.html">Question typology</a>, a method for extracting surface motifs that recur in questions, and for grouping them according to their latent rhetorical role (see the <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Asking_too_much.html">Asking too much</a> paper)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Coming soon: Politeness, currently available here: <a href="https://github.com/sudhof/politeness">Politeness API</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Coming soon: Basic message and turn features, currently available here <a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/Cornell-Conversational-Analysis-Toolkit/tree/constructive/cornellversation/constructive">Constructive conversations</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
