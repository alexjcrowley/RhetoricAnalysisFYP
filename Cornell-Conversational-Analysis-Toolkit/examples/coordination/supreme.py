# This example uses the supreme court corpus to reproduce figures 4 and 5 from
#   the echoes of power paper (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Echoes_of_power.html).
#
# The plots answer these questions:
# - Do lawyers coordinate more to justices than the other way around?
# - Do lawyers coordinate more to unfavorable or favorable justices?
# - Do unfavorable justices coordinate to lawyers more than favorable justices,
#     or vice versa?
